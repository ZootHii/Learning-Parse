# Learning-Parse
Simple instagram-like app
Not completed because parse is old and has some problems that I can't solve but still you can share photos that you take with your camera or that you chose the photo from your gallery.
Also you can upload a profile photo, the other users can see your posts and profile photo and you can see theirs in Selfie(feed) tab. 
I did this project because I am trying to see how the camre apps and the other concepts work and such things.
